# Smart-Feeder

This is one of my projects that developed my engineering skills. With the use of Smart Feeder you can feed a pet without leaving your bed. By accessing the Smart Feeder website on your laptop or mobile phone, you can easily manage the door's movement.

The project consist of phisical feeder model and a web page which is runed from the level of ESP32 microcontroller with Wi-Fi module. This allows users to connect to the website through their home Wi-Fi network. The feeder's door can be opened at four levels: Closed, Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. The current door position is indicated on the website and through LEDs attached to the physical model. Under "EXTRA" button, which links to a website connected with healthy rules for feeding dogs you will find various statistics. To refresh the page, users simply need to press one of the designated refresh buttons. The project's programming was executed using the Arduino IDE.

Please, keep in mind that this is only a concept project which was created in order to enhance my programming skills and to gain familiarity with electronics and microcontrollers.
